**To install on mobile:**

#### React Native (requires conversion)

## Testing Your PWA

1. **Local testing:**
   - Use a local server: `python -m http.server 8000` or `npx serve`
   - Open on mobile browser via your computer's IP address

2. **Deploy online:**
   - Use GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel
   - HTTPS required for PWA features

## Icon Requirements

For better app appearance, replace the placeholder icons:
- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels

Use tools like Canva, Figma, or online icon generators to create professional icons.

## Next Steps

2. **Create proper app icons** 
3. **Deploy to a hosting service** for online access
4. **Consider native app development** if you need device-specific features
